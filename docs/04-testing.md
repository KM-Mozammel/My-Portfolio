4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: The website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge) to ensure consistent performance and appearance.

5. **Responsive Testing**: The website was tested on various devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile) to ensure it is responsive and provides a good user experience on all screen sizes.

## Testing Results
